        <h4>Who Stefan Zweig ?</h4>
        <p>Stefan Zweig was an Austrian writer, playwright, journalist, and biographer born on November 28, 1881, in Vienna, Austria. He is best known for his novellas, biographies, and his prominent cultural presence during the early 20th century. Zweig came from a wealthy Jewish family, which allowed him to pursue a thorough education in literature and philosophy at the University of Vienna.

            Zweig's early works included poetry and translations, but he soon gained fame with his novellas such as "Letter from an Unknown Woman" and "Amok." He also wrote notable biographies, including "Marie Antoinette: The Portrait of an Average Woman" and "Erasmus of Rotterdam," which demonstrated his deep historical knowledge and narrative skill.

            His works often explored themes of psychological insight and the human condition, reflecting the tumultuous times in which he lived. Zweig's writing style is characterized by its elegant prose and empathetic portrayal of characters' inner lives.

            The rise of the Nazi regime forced Zweig, a Jew and a pacifist, to flee Austria in 1934. He lived in various countries before settling in Brazil. The loss of his homeland and the spread of fascism left Zweig in despair. Tragically, he and his wife Lotte committed suicide in 1942 in Petrópolis, Brazil.

            Stefan Zweig remains a significant literary figure, with his works continuing to be read and appreciated worldwide for their depth, humanity, and historical context.</p>
